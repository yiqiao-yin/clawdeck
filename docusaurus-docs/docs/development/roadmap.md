## 🚀 Suggested Expansions

### Phase 1: Enhanced Context Management ✅ COMPLETED (v0.2.8)

#### 1.1 Conversation History in API Calls
**Current:** History stored locally but not sent to API
**Proposed:** Send conversation history to maintain context across turns

**Benefits:**
- Agent remembers previous interactions
- "Continue from where we left off" workflows
- Better follow-up question handling

**Implementation:**
```python
# In agent.py chat() method
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_prompt}]
messages.extend(self.conversation_history)
result = await self.agent.run(user_message, message_history=messages)
```

**Considerations:**
- Token usage increases significantly
- Need context window management (max tokens)
- Add option to disable for cost savings

**Priority:** HIGH - Most requested feature

---

#### 1.2 Context Management Commands
**Feature:** User control over conversation context

**Commands:**
```bash
/clear      # Clear conversation history
/history    # Show conversation history
/save       # Save session to file
/load       # Load previous session
/token      # Show token usage stats
```

**Implementation:**
- Add slash command parsing in CLI
- Store sessions as JSON
- Display token counts per message

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

### Phase 2: Additional Tools ✅ COMPLETED (v0.2.9)

#### 2.1 Git Operations Tool
**Why:** Most developers use git constantly

**Tool Functions:**
```python
async def git_status(self, ctx: RunContext[None]) -> str:
    """Get current git status"""

async def git_diff(self, ctx: RunContext[None], file_path: str = None) -> str:
    """Show git diff for file or all changes"""

async def git_commit(self, ctx: RunContext[None], message: str) -> str:
    """Create git commit with message"""

async def git_branch(self, ctx: RunContext[None]) -> str:
    """List branches"""
```

**Use Cases:**
- "Show me what files changed"
- "Commit these changes with message 'Add feature X'"
- "What branch am I on?"

**Priority:** HIGH - Frequently needed

---

#### 2.2 Search/Grep Tool
**Why:** Find code patterns across files

**Tool Function:**
```python
async def search_files(
    self,
    ctx: RunContext[None],
    pattern: str,
    file_pattern: str = "*.py"
) -> str:
    """Search for pattern in files matching file_pattern"""
```

**Use Cases:**
- "Find all functions that use 'requests' library"
- "Where is the User class defined?"
- "Show me all TODO comments"

**Priority:** HIGH - Essential for large codebases

---

#### 2.3 File Management Tools
**Why:** Complete file system operations

**Tool Functions:**
```python
async def delete_file(self, ctx: RunContext[None], file_path: str) -> str:
    """Delete a file (with confirmation)"""

async def move_file(
    self,
    ctx: RunContext[None],
    source: str,
    destination: str
) -> str:
    """Move or rename file"""

async def create_directory(self, ctx: RunContext[None], dir_path: str) -> str:
    """Create directory structure"""
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM

---

### Phase 3: Model Selection & Optimization ✅ COMPLETED (v0.3.0)

#### 3.1 Dynamic Model Switching
**Feature:** Choose model based on task complexity

**Implementation:**
```python
# In CLI
clawdeck --model haiku      # Fast & cheap for simple tasks
clawdeck --model sonnet     # Default - balanced
clawdeck --model opus       # Most capable - expensive

# Or dynamic in-session
"Use Haiku for this simple task"
"Switch to Opus for complex refactoring"
```

**Cost Optimization:**
| Model | Input Cost | Output Cost | Best For |
|-------|-----------|-------------|----------|
| Haiku | $0.25/M | $1.25/M | Simple file ops, quick questions |
| Sonnet | $3.00/M | $15.00/M | General coding, analysis |
| Opus | $15.00/M | $75.00/M | Complex reasoning, architecture |

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Good for power users

---

#### 3.2 Automatic Model Selection
**Feature:** Agent chooses appropriate model for task

**Logic:**
```python
def suggest_model(task_description: str) -> str:
    if is_simple_task(task_description):
        return "haiku"  # "read file", "list files"
    elif is_complex_task(task_description):
        return "opus"   # "refactor architecture", "design system"
    else:
        return "sonnet"  # Default
```

**Priority:** LOW - Nice to have

---

### Phase 4: Configuration & Personalization ✅ COMPLETED (v0.3.1)

#### 4.1 Configuration File
**Feature:** Persistent user preferences

**File:** `~/.clawdeck/config.yaml`
```yaml
# Default settings
model: claude-sonnet-4-6
max_tokens: 4096
temperature: 0.7

# Custom system prompt additions
custom_instructions: |
  - Always use type hints
  - Follow PEP 8 strictly

  test: "pytest tests/ -v --cov"
```

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Great for teams

---

### Phase 5: Streaming Responses ✅ COMPLETED (v0.3.2, bugfixes v0.3.3-0.3.4)

#### 5.1 Token-by-Token Streaming
**Why:** See responses as they generate (like ChatGPT)

**Current Experience:**
```
You: Generate a large script
[Spinner for 10 seconds]
Clawdeck: [Entire response appears at once]
```

**Proposed Experience:**
```
You: Generate a large script
Clawdeck: I'll create a comprehensive... [tokens appear as generated]
```

**Implementation:**
```python
# Use async streaming API
async for chunk in agent.run_stream(user_message):
    print(chunk, end='', flush=True)
```

**Benefits:**
- Feels faster (immediate feedback)
- Can cancel long responses
- Better UX for lengthy outputs

**Priority:** HIGH - Significant UX improvement

    emoji: str = "🔥",
    color_from: str = "indigo",
    color_to: str = "green",
    license: str = "mit"
) -> str:
    """Generate README.md with HuggingFace Space frontmatter"""
```

**Workflow:**
1. User creates an app (e.g., Streamlit chatbot) using Clawdeck-CLI
2. User says "push to huggingface"
3. Clawdeck checks for HF_TOKEN authentication
4. If not authenticated, asks for token and authenticates
5. Generates README.md with proper YAML frontmatter for Spaces

**Example Use Case:**
```
You: Create a simple Streamlit echo chatbot

Clawdeck: [Creates app.py with Streamlit code]

You: Push this to HuggingFace

Clawdeck: Let me check your HuggingFace authentication...
Not authenticated. Please provide your HuggingFace token.
Get one from: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

You: hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxx

Clawdeck: ✓ Authenticated as 'username'
Creating README.md with Streamlit Space configuration...
✓ README.md created

[Phase 2 will add: Space creation and file upload]
```

**Test Coverage:**
- 12 new unit tests (7 in test_agent.py, 5 in test_utils.py)
- Tests for authentication checking (authenticated/not authenticated)
- Tests for authentication success/failure
- Tests for README creation (Streamlit, Gradio, Docker, Static)
- Tests for username extraction from HF CLI output

**Priority:** HIGH - Enables direct deployment to HuggingFace Spaces

    ctx: RunContext[None],
    space_name: str,
    sdk: str = "streamlit",
    private: bool = False
) -> str:
    """Create HuggingFace Space via CLI"""

async def push_to_hf_space(
    self,
    ctx: RunContext[None],
    space_name: str,
    files: List[str] = None
) -> str:
    """Upload files to HuggingFace Space"""
```

**HuggingFace CLI Commands Used:**
```bash
# Create Space
hf repo create {space_name} --type=space --space-sdk={sdk}

# Upload files
hf upload {space_name} {file_path}
# or upload entire directory
hf upload {space_name} . --repo-type=space
```
